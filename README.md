# Flappy Bird AI with NEAT

A sophisticated Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game, enhanced with AI capabilities using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. This project offers both a human-playable mode and an AI training environment, complete with real-time visualization and control features.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Experience the original Flappy Bird mechanics.
- **AI Training with NEAT**: Utilize the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks that learn to play the game.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Observe the AI's learning process with dynamic visual feedback.
- **Training Control Panel**: Monitor live statistics and adjust training parameters on the fly.
- **Save States and Checkpoints**: Save progress and resume training from checkpoints.
- **Model Testing Interface**: Evaluate the performance of trained models.
- **Human Playable Mode**: Switch to manual mode for a traditional gaming experience.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Core source code for game logic and AI integration.
- **`assets/`**: Visual and audio assets used in the game.
- **`models/`**: Directory for storing trained AI models.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunnycreado/flappy-bird-ai.git
   cd flappy-bird-ai
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Game**:
   Launch the game using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Human Mode**: Play the game manually using keyboard controls.
- **AI Training Mode**: Initiate AI training to evolve a model capable of playing the game autonomously.
